# WristRest
### A Chrome extension to help reduce RSI

## What is it?
WristRest is a simple Chrome extension that keeps track of how long you have been typing on your keyboard and reminds you to take periodic breaks. It has been proven that these short but frequent breaks helps reduce wrist strain when typing. 

## How do I use it?
When the app loads for the first time it automatically starts the timer&mdash;it requires no input from you. After every 10 minute period, the app will start a 30-second micro-break and alert you that the break has started. After every 30 minute interval, the app will start a 5-minute rest break and alert you that the break has started. You can stop the timer by clicking the stop button, and start it again by clikcing the start button.

## What is RSI?
Repetitive Strain Injury, or RSI, is an uncomfortable but highly treatable condition experienced by many people who use keyboards for 
long periods of time each day. Basically, making the same repeated motions with your wrists, especially if you don't hold them properly or 
use good posture, can harm the nerve connections that pass through your wrist. 

Common symptoms of RSI include tingling or loss of sensation in some or all fingers. It can be treated by simply resting the wrists for an 
extended period of time (usually a few days). 

RSI can be prevented, though, by taking short, frequent breaks from typing. The goal of this project is to remind users to take these breaks
and save their wrists.

~~1. Consider upgrading to Chrome's Event Pages/Alarm API paradigm to save on performance, but need to figure out how to best do that while still maintaining the basic functionality of the app.~~

Go nuts. This code is not documented very well but feel free to make improvements where you see fit&mdash;it would always be nice to get a couple things on the list above checked off, but if you have something else you really want done, send me a message to run it by me and then go ahead.
