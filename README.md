# WristRest
### A Chrome extension to help reduce RSI

## What is it?
WristRest is a simple Chrome extension that keeps track of how long you have been typing on your keyboard and reminds you to 
take periodic breaks. It has been proven that these short but frequent breaks helps reduce wrist strain when typing. 

## How do I use it?
<Section coming soon as extension functionality and UI is finalized>

## What is RSI?
Repetitive Strain Injury, or RSI, is an uncomfortable but highly treatable condition experienced by many people who use keyboards for 
long periods of time each day. Basically, making the same repeated motions with your wrists, especially if you don't hold them properly or 
use good posture, can harm the nerve connections that pass through your wrist. 

Common symptoms of RSI include tingling or loss of sensation in some or all fingers. It can be treated by simply resting the wrists for an 
extended period of time (usually a few days). 

RSI can be prevented, though, by taking short, frequent breaks from typing. The goal of this project is to remind users to take these breaks
and save their wrists.

## Future Updates
Coming soon to WristRest:

1. Background scripting and automatic start of timer
1. Inclusion of pause buttons
1. Actual actions when a micro or rest break arises
1. Ability to skip or postpone breaks
1. Edge extension
1. Consider upgrading to Chrome's Event Pages/Alarm API paradigm to save on performance, but need to figure out how to best do that while 
   still maintaining the basic functionality of the app. __(in progress)__
